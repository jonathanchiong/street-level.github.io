The extreme volatility in global markets post-Brexit is a knee-jerk reaction of the uncertainty and lack of confidence in the world's economy, in particular Europe.  The bigger implication, however, is the risk of a [Brexit contagion]( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/684131/brexit-eu-referendum-tsunami-france-italy-netherlands) of Europe. Negotiation on the Brexit terms could take a few years.  While many investors are understandably feeling uncertain during this period, we should stay focus on the longer term opportunities that arises to navigate through the political chaos. <!--more-->

We believe that the economic fallout will be largely limited to Britain, and to a lesser extend Europe. Asia has strong fundamentals that should hold up well, if not gain positively from Brexit.  We believe that the markets have overlook stocks with solid fundamentals, and the current volatility may now present a good opportunity to buy strong dividend yielding property stocks and and hold for long terms.  For example, many property developers and REITs listed in Singapore  has no or little exposure to UK or Europe, but may see prices being pull down together with the broader market.  This could present an attractive entry point for people who are interested in the sector.

We expect to see stronger investments flows back to Asia Pacific over the next few months, reversing a trend of fund flows into Europe for the last 3 years. We believe these investments would first find their way into the more developed markets of Asia Pacific such as Japan, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.  As a result, we believe that asset prices in these countries will continue to stay expensive due to the demand and the low interest rates environment.  For Singapore, the growth trajectory is still weak and we do not expect significant rental growth in the next 1-2 years.  However, we believe that the inflow of capital would hold up asset prices steadily in the near term.

Another major theme we expect to see is the focus on quality. There will be a divergence in share price performance between good quality stocks and sub-par companies.  Property developers with financial strength, strong track record and a reputable brand would emerge stronger from this volatility, and REITs backed by strong sponsors with well-located assets should be able to hold up well.  The key to riding out this volatile market where valuations are still slightly  expensive is finding the right entry price for good quality companies and assets.  
We will discuss this in more detail in our subsequent posts.
