Street Level is written and produced by two guys based in Singapore.

We are two guys with a passion for finance and investing. After almost a decade in high finance, we yearn to find a space to share our own insights beyond our usual circle of friends in the industry and to learn more from a wider audience in return.

After long discussions over lunches & shorter ones at the office watercooler, we feel that there is a lack of Singapore focused writing discussing real estate investments â€“ in-depth articles with a careful balance of technical analysis and simple writing. We hope you will find these articles useful in your own personal pursuit of financial freedom.

That is why we started Street Level.

<h3>What is Street Level?</h3>

We discuss on all things related to real estate investments in Singapore. We will also talk about other topics we find useful, in terms of growing our hard earned income, working towards achieving some semblance of financial independence and personal finance tips we had found handy over the years.

Financial concepts and jargons are oftentimes overly complicated. We strive to write authentically, in a way that our own friends not in the industry can easily understand. We will be candid in our views and hope that our experience in the industry will allow us to provide an unique perspective to Real Estate investments in Singapore.
