We guess if you are launching a financial blog, what better day to do it than on [Brexit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgKHSNqxa8) where UK just [voted](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-referendum/) for a smaller, less inclusive, less open soceity. We see similar echos of this on our very own red dot, with the largest public protest ever organized in Singapore's history over the 2013 Population White Paper. Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement, Arab Springs, the rise of Trump, etc. - the people are voting unconventionally because of inequality, unhappy but yet do not know what to do.

More recently, some pundits even commented that the subsquent curbs on foreign labour growth as a result of the fallout contributed to the recent "National Swing" in the General Elections.
