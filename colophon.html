<br>We are two guys based in Singapore with a passion for finance and investing. After almost a decade in high finance, we yearn to find a space to share our own insights beyond our usual circle of friends in the industry and to learn more in return.</br>

<br>After long discussions over lunch & shorter ones at the office watercooler, we found that there is a lack of Singapore focused blogs discussing real estate investments – in-depth articles with a careful balance of technical analysis and simple writing. We hope you will find this useful in your own personal pursuit of financial freedom.</br>

<br>That is why we started Street Level.</br>


<h3>What is Street Level?</h3>

We are focused on all things related to real estate investments in Singapore. We will also discuss topics on growing your wealth, achieving financial independence and some personal money management tips we had found handy over the years.

Financial concepts and jargons are oftentimes complex and (to be honest) boring.  So, we strive to do this in a way that the “man on the street” can easily understand.

We will be candid in our views and our experiences in the industry allow us to provide an insider perspective to the world of the real estate investing.  We aim to provide executable investible advices to help growth your wealth and increase your investment knowledge.  We believe we can be your trusted guides in navigating the seemingly complex investment landscape to grow your wealth.
