We are two guys based in Singapore with a passion for finance and investing. Our journey begins with our career in the financial services industry, where we still hold day jobs in the real estate investment and banking sector.  Like the man (and woman) on the street, we are part of the rat race, stays in HDB flat, strive to achieve financial freedom in the highly competitive and fast-paced society of Singapore.  

Over the years, we found that our colleagues and friends desire proper quality investment advices.  However, we find that there is a lack of good local blogs discussing topics on real estate investments – good blogs that has a combination of sound technical knowledge and investment ideas explained in a simple manner. We realize that we have the skills and expertise to help empower the white-collar middle-class in Singapore to take charge of his or her own investments and finances to break out of the rat race.

That is why we started Street Level.
