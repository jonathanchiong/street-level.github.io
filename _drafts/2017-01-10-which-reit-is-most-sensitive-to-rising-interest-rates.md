The US Federal Reserve [hike interest rates](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurengensler/2016/12/14/federal-reserve-december-rate-hike/#44b027dd1229) for the second time in a decade on 14 December 2016.  Singapore interest rates correspondingly rose following the Feds hike with the [3-month SIBOR and SOR continually testing the 1% level](http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/pressure-on-sibor-sor-continues-in-the-new-year-rising-to-around-1) in the last few weeks.  Market is now expecting the Feds to be more aggressive in raising rates in 2017, with three rate hikes anticipated for the year.  Interest cost have the biggest impact on profitability for real estate investors, and the risk and impact of rising rates needs to be duly considered.  

In this article, we share our views on the impact of rising rates on Singapore REITs(S-REITs).  Most S-REITs have well-managed debt profile and are not overly leveraged (lesson gleaned from the the global financial crisis).  While higher financing costs can negatively impact a REIT's cashflow, we do not think that rising interest rate is a significant downside risk to the S-REIT sector.<!--more-->

### Methodology of our analysis
Our analysis focus only on the largest 25 REITs by market capitalisation listed on SGX.  We will consider the impact of a 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75% and 1.00% increase in interest costs on the REITs' distributable income.  The sensitivity is performed on the unhedged portion of the REIT's borrowings.  We will first discuss the debt/interest rate related factors that could negatively impact a REIT's distribution and conclude with the analysis that takes all these factors into consideration.

### Higher leveraged REITs are typically more sensitive to rising rates
Probably the most obvious point - the higher leverage a REIT is, the more sensitive it is to higher interest costs.  S-REITs on average is geared at 34% debt-to-assets.  There is a 45% regulatory cap on the leverage an S-REIT can take.  The highest leveraged REIT is Ascott Residence Trust(ART) at 41.0% leverage, which is still well within the regulatory cap.   Temasek-linked REITs tend to have stronger financial flexibility and influence when it comes to bank borrowings or tapping the debt capital markets.  Therefore, it is no coincidence that the 3 highest leveraged REITs are Temasek-linked REITs.

### Interest rate swaps and fixed-rate debt mitigates interest rate risk
Most S-REITs hedged a substantial portion of their bank borrowings through interest rates swaps or options.  S-REITs can also tap the bond market for fixed-rate medium term debt.  Another common source of fixed-rate debt is the bonds market.  Most bond issuance in Singapore are fixed rate bonds and REITs with the ability to tap the bond market for fixed rate medium term notes have the advantage to lock-in interest costs for the medium term.On average, S-REITs hedged approximately 79% of their borrowings.  Among the 25 REITs analyzed,  14 has more than 80% of their borrowings hedged. It must however be noted that most hedges are for the short to mid-term (it gets expensive to hedge interest rates beyond 3-5 years).  So eventually, in the longer run, the higher interest rates will impact the REITs.  However, for the scope of our analysis, we will only assess the risk of  of rising rates in the next 12 months as we believe that longer term interest rate rises should correspond to better economic fundametals which will in turn accelerate topline growth of the REIT and thereby minimizing, if not improving, a REIT's distribution.

### Office and Retail REITs are more exposed in a rising rate environment
Office and retail properties tend to have lower yields as compared with industrial/logistic REITs. A typical Grade-A office building or a retail mall in Singapore yields about 3-5% while an industrial/logistic property yields about 7-9%.  Therefore, financing expenses as a proportion to revenue are higher for office and retail assets, resulting in greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

### Potential impact of rising rates on S-REITs 
Taking the above into considerations, the diagram below provides the output of our analysis.

The top 3 REIT most sensitive to higher interest rates are CapitaLand Retail China Trust(CRCT), Keppel REIT(K-REIT) and CDL Hospitality Trusts(CDL-HT). These REITs are characterised by lower proportion of hedging on their debt at 53%, 74% and 61% respectively and above average leverage (though we caveat that they still have a substantial headroom before reaching the regulatory cap).  Taking all into consideration, it seems that the short-term impact of higher rates on distributable income of the REITs is not substantial.  On average, the reduction in distributable income is only 2.1% and 1.1% for a 1% and 0.5% rise in rates respectively, supported by the large proportion of hedging and generally lower leverage of Singapore REITs.

### Conclusion - Rising rates should not pose a significant risk to S-REITs in the short-term
Our analysis is purely mathematical.  It does not mean that REITs more sensitive to rising interest rate are necessarily REITs to avoid investing in as there are other factors to consider in assessing the potential viability of a REIT investment.  While it is market consensus for interest rates to rise in 2017, it is also our view that any increase will be modest.  Coupled with the generally conservative capital structure of most S-REITs, we think that REIT distributions should not be materially impacted by rising interest rates in the short-term.  You can also refer to our [earlier article](http://www.street-level.co/2016/11/25/singapore-reits-is-it-time-to-invest.html) where we share the reasons for our view of a sructurally lower inteest rate environment in the next decade.
