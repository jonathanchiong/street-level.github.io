In 3Q2016, Singapore's private residential property prices continue to slide by 1.5%. This takes the total drop in property prices to 11% from its peak in 2013.  Market watchers and potential investors continue to search for the elusive bottom in this property cycle.  We believe that there is room for further decline in property prices and we share some key reasons behind our view. <!--more-->

### 1. Demand for residential units is weak and will continue to remain weak
Both leasing and buying demand for private residential units are highly correlated to the growth in the population of permanent residents (PRs) and non-residents (NRs, defined as non-resident with work passes and foreign students).  With the tightening of immigration and foreign labour policy since 2011, the growth in the number of PRs and NRs has remain low at an average of 1.8% in the last 3 years; the number of PRs have remain flattish in the last 5 years.

This has resulted in a weak rental market for residential units.  The rental market is one of the  leading indicators of property prices.  With the rental index dropping 5.9% since the beginning of 2015 and 1.2% in the 3Q2016, there is no signs that the decline is slowing down.  It is currently a tenant's market and rents looks set to decline further for the remaining of 2016 and 2017.  

## 2.  Significant number of completions in the last 3 years has resulted in the doubling of vacancies.
From the lows of approximately 5% vacancy in early 2011, vacancies has since risen to and is now hovering at around 9% based on the latest data from URA.

There is still substantial completions in 2017 and 2018, albiet at a slower rate than 2016.  Over 31,000 units will be completed between 2017 and 2018.  The market will take sometime to absorb these supply. We therefore expect vacancies to increase further, possibly going into double digit % as these completed units hit the market in the next 24 months.

## 3. Policy will remains restrictive and removal of cooling measures not expected to take place in the near future.  
The [benign job market](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/layoffs-jobless-rates-rise-amid-sluggish-economy) is a concern for the goverment. Household debt among Singaporeans is [near all time high](http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/steep-household-debt-biggest-speed-bump-ahead-singapore-report) and the largest proportion of household debt is from property mortgages. The goverment will continue to focus on affordability of housing as a priority, therefore we do not expect the government to implement any policy that would have the potential of increasing property prices in the near term.

In conclusion, we are of the view that the weak demand and strong supply will continue to weigh on residential property prices in Singapore in the next 18 to 24 months. Property prices will probably see another 5-10% decline before a bottom is reached. Properties in Core Central Region (CCR) should hold up relatively better as compared to Rest of Central Region (RCR) and Outside Central Region (OCR).  Investors should remain cautious and do proper due diligence when considering residential property investments.
