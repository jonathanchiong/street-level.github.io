Singaporeans usually prefers to invest in private residential properties as compared to Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs).  We believe this is largely due to the (i) emotional security of holding a tangible asset, (ii) potential for sizable capital gains, and (iii) familarity with the asset class (everyone stays in one).

However, the merits of investing in REITs could far outweigh the reasons for investing in residential property (and its risks are also easier to manage).  We believe that generally there is a lack of understanding on investing in REITs. <!--more-->For example, people have the notion that REITs have high income yield, but low capital gains.  However, as REITs (which are essentially "bite-size' real estate) are traded on the stock exchange, the price of a REIT can somewhat acts like a stock - moving according to market sentiments, even when the underlying real estate do not change in value on a day-to-day basis.  This allows shrewed investors to take advantage of the price movements to make a sizable capital gain on top of income distribution.

Singapore REITs (S-REITs) are the one of the best yielding in the world comparing with other established REIT market like the US, UK, Japan and Australia.  Potential investors who likes exposure to the real estate sector can look at S-REITs as a viable alternative to private residential property. REITs allows retail investor who do not have a huge capital base, to start investing small and  build up a portfolio of good dividend yielding REITs over time.

In the table below, we highlight some of the pros and cons of investing in REIT comparing with investing in private residential property.
