With all the uncertainty around the global economic climate and the pace of Singapore's economic growth, it is a challenge for real estate investors to seek out profitable investment strategies at the moment.  We have strong reasons to believe that hotel REITs is a sub-sector to watch out for and could outperform other REIT sectors in the mid-term.  In this post, we share our thoughts on the key demand drivers for the travel industry and how hotel REITs will benefit from the trend.

### Millennials love to travel and travel spending is becoming a core part of their expenditure
Millennials, defined as those born from the 1980s onwards, have different spending mindset as compared with previous generations. They are willing to spend on experiences - outdoor dining at nice restaurants, fun activities (eg. paintball, escape room, art jam sessions, etc) and overseas holiday travel.  An [article] (http://thegbrief.com/articles/millennial-expectations-are-reshaping-travel-industry-602) published earlier this year shed some light on the impact of millennials on the travel industry.  It was highlighted that nowadays millenials travel more often for business (4.7 times each year) and leisure (4.2 times per year) as compared to the previous generations.  As more and more of those born in/after 1980s reaches working age, with many also reaching their peak spending power, this spending behaviour could reshape the travel industry in the years to come.

### Proliferation of low cost carriers and cheap energy costs will continue to support travel demand
A key structural change in aviation industry over the past decade has been the proliferation of low-cost carriers (LCCs).  LCCs have been the favoured mode of airline start-ups over last decade, and their popularity around the  world has caused a fundamental shift in the competitive dynamic of the industry.  Coupled with lower energy costs in the last 2 years, the increased in the number of LCCs have supported the growth in [international tourism](http://media.unwto.org/press-release/2016-01-18/international-tourist-arrivals-4-reach-record-12-billion-2015).  

### Singapore tourist arrivals have recovered strongly in 2016, but yet to be reflected in hotel occupancy and room rates
In Singapore, after 2 years of muted growth in tourism numbers (due to aviation disasters and curbs by Chinese authorities on low-cost shopping tours), we see a strong broad-based recovery in international touris arrivals since the start of 2016.  As of May 2016, international visitor arrivals grew 13% year-on-year (y-o-y), led by arrivals from China (+55% y-o-y), Indonesia (+9% y-o-y) and  India (+10% y-o-y).  Tourism arrivals from other ASEAN countries such as Thailand (+21% y-o-y) and Vietnam (+10% y-o-y) also saw a double digit growth.   Singapore continues to be seen as a regional tourist base for Western tourists visiting Asia/Southeast Asia. Tourist arrivals from Europe, which accounts for 11% of total tourists in Singapore, also saw a double digit growth of 12% y-o-y, notwithstanding the weaker European currencies.

Overall, we see the increase in tourism arrivals also reflected in the increase in tourism spending in the last few years.  Hotel room revenues grew 12.6% per annum over the last 7 years and hotel F&B revenue grew 8.6% per annum.

But the strong growth has yet to translate to higher hotel occupancy rates and room rates.  This is due to the large incoming supply of hotel rooms in 2016 and 2017.

This supply, however, will taper off significantly from 2018 and we believe this would reverse the trend in occupancy and room rate growth in the next 12 to 18 months.

### Currency volatility and weak economic sentiments are key risks, but alternative accomodation platforms unlikely to post a threat to hotel demand

The risk to our view is a strong Singapore dollar which will limit tourist spending, and "weaker-for-longer" global economic sentiments which will result in a decline for business travels.  We do not see alternative accomodation platforms (such as AirBNB) as a major threat to hotel demand.  These alternative accomodation providers tend to target a different segment of the travellers market, e.g. travellers who prefers a "home-like" experience, travellers on medium-term stays, or family/multi-family travel groups.  Hotels on the other hand offers a higher level of service experience and more amenities.  The core traveller demand for the hotel experience would likely not be materially canibalized by alternative accomodation provider.  It is also worth mentioning that the Singapore government have been [taking action against short-term rentals of private homes] (http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2016/8/133271/action-taken-against-44-illegal-short-term-rentals-in-2016-mnd) which is not allowed in Singapore

### Impact of the Zika virus in Singapore should not pose a significant threat
We do not think that the spread of the Zika virus is a major [threat to the tourism in Singapore] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-singapore-idUSKCN1150HM).  The Singapore government have always been quick and efficient in dealing with such situations.  Economic impact should be minimal and should not be compared with the outbreak of severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS) in 2013 as the mode of transmission is different and more limited.  

### Short-term headwinds but strong fundamentals of the travel industry should drive mid-term value of hotel REITs
In summary, we believe that although there are short-term headwinds, the fundamentals for the hotel market remains strong and outlook is positive.  The Singapore government's initiative to spur tourism through the SGD 700million Tourism Development Fund is expected to help keep the industry robust through the development of tourism products and improving productivity through technology.  The short-term headwinds against Singapore-listed hotel REITs will present a good entry point for investors who are looking to gain exposure to the hotel sector for the long term.
