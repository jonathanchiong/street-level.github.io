Singapore REITs(S-REITs) offers high and stable dividend yields from exposure to primarily the Singapore real estate sector, and across Asia Pacific real estate. It is the [highest yielding REIT market](http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapore-reits-offer-highest-dividend-yields-among-developed-markets) among developed countries, yielding over 6% per annum on average.  

But not all S-REIT sectors are the same and carefully selecting your exposure to the right sector can help you outperform the general S-REIT market.  In this article, we provide our views and comparison on key real estate fundamentals - rental growth, upcoming supply, potential threats, and valuation - across the various S-REIT sectors.  We will only focus on S-REITs with a primary exposure to Singapore real estate in this analysis. 

### Retail
**Rental Growth**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Rental growth for retail spaces is on a gradual decline, particularly for City Area shopping malls, with the area's median rental declining 8-10% yoy based on the latest statistics from the [Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)](http://www.ura.gov.sg). While the pace of rental decline is slowing, the growth outlook of the retail sector remains fragile, hampered by structural changes in consumer behavior and the benign employment environment in Singapore.  Consumers will be cautious in discretionary spending given the uncertainty in job security and wages growth.  We expect retail rents to at best be flattish in the next 12 months.

**Upcoming Supply**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Retail spaces that are coming onboard in 2017 and 2018 remains high, further dampening any potential growth in the sector.  Based on URA's statistics, retail vacancy is at it highest since 2010 at 8.4% vacancy rate.  While the supply of retail spaces as a percentage of existing retail spaces is declining, the lack of strong leasing demand means that the existing vacancy will still take time for the market to absorb. 

**Threats**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Online shopping have been a major threat to the retail industry.  Mall operators are introducing new experiential concepts and more F&B options to counteract the threat of e-commerce.

**Trading Valuation**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Retail S-REITs are trading at an average yield of 6.3% and 0.96x P/NAV.

**Preferred Sector Pick**<br>
We prefer Frasers Centerpoint Trust as its shopping centres are heartland malls strategically located next to and with connectivity to MRT stations and/or bus interchanges which are typically more defensive and well supported by sustainable footfalls.  Its key assets are Causeway Point, Northpoint and Changi City Point which acccounts for more than 80% of the REIT's cashflows.

<br>
### Office
**Rental Growth**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Average city area office rents declined 10% yoy to S$9 per square feet per month based on latest URA statistics, due to weak leasing demand and large influx of supply.  With no major significant drivers of office space demand in sight, we believe that there is still further downside for office rents of about 5-10%.  We note however that the pace of rental decline has slowed consecutively in the last three quarters and a bottoming could be near.

**Upcoming Supply**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
A record amount of office space is coming onboard in the city area in 2017 should add pressure to occupancy levels in the near term.  However, limited supply from 2018 to 2020 should provide support for office rents from 2018 onwards.

**Threats**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Key risk for office demand is prolonged global economic headwinds and a continued contraction of the financial services and oil and gas sector.  

**Trading Valuation**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Office S-REITs are trading at an average yield of 6.1% and 0.84x P/NAV.

**Preferred Sector Pick**<br>
We prefer CapitaLand Commercial Trust for its larger and more diversified portfolio anchored around the traditional CBD area of Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place area.  Rents in those areas are lower and less volatitle (as compared to Marina Bay area).  The REIT also has two assets - Six Battery Road and HSBC Building - who are on effectively freehold tenure in core locations, which is nowdays rare to acquire in Singapore.  

<br>
### Industrial/Logistics
**Rental Growth**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Industrial rents on average has decline 7% yoy, based on latest JTC data, with the largest decline seen in the warehouse and multi-user factory segments.  Rents in this categories should continue to see further declines given the general weaknesss in manufacturing and transport sectors.  we do not see any immediate improvement in demand drivers and expect rents to further decline 5-10% in the near term.  Business parks and single-user factory rents, howeever are more resilent; The former is anchored by leasing demands from the technology and media industry and the latter is usually driven by end-user demand.  

**Upcoming Supply**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Record supply in 2016 and 2017 and subdued demand should continue to restrict the growth of the industrial real estate sector.  However bulk of the supply (60%) for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 are multi-user factories and warehouses.  Most of the single-user factory supply are pre-committed build-to-suit solutions for established tenants, which should support occupancy levels for the sub-sector.

**Threats**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Weak exports and manufacturing environement limits expansion plans.  However, the governments focus towards automation and hi-tech industry should promote the use of modern hi-end industrial and logistics space.

**Trading Valuation**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Industrial S-REITs are trading at an average yield of 7.1% and 1.11x P/NAV.

**Preferred Sector Picks**<br>
We like Mapletree Logistic Trust for its geographically diversified portfolio in Asia and its ability to develop modern logistics facility in the region.  The logistics sub-sector in Asia should do relatively well supported by demands from third party logistics players and e-commerce activities.  [Amazon recently signed a lease](http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/amazon-takes-up-100000-sq-ft-at-mapletree-facility-sources) for 100,000 square feet of spaces at Mapletree Logistics Hub at Toh Guan area.

### Hospitality
**RevPar Growth**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
The hospitality real estate sector is probably the only real estate sub-sector that is seeing a strong demand growth at the moment. Tourism arrivals grew double digit to date driven by broadbase growth in arrivals from China, Indoensia, India and Thailand.  With a fundamental change in [spending behvaior of millenials](http://thegbrief.com/articles/millennial-expectations-are-reshaping-travel-industry-602) and the rise of the middle-income group in Asia, robust travel activities and travel spending in the region is expected to continue and should help drive the increase in room rates for the hotel industry in Singapore.

**Upcoming Supply**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Large addition of new rooms in 2017 will keep RevPar growth subdue in 2017. However, we believe that occupancy (and correspendingly room rates) will pick up from 2018 onwards where there is limited supply coming onboard.

**Threats**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Unforeseen major epidemic in the region or geopolitical events could curtail the growth of the tourism industry in Asia Pacific.  Tourism activities are typically less sticky and travel spending can fall off quickly, of which the impact can hit hospitality REITs faster as compared to other sectors.

**Trading Valuation**
<img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><img src="http://www.street-level.co/assets/Star.png" width="25px"><br>
Hospitality S-REITs are trading at an average yield of 7.5% and 0.83x P/NAV. This is highest yielding and arguably the most undervalued sector among S-REITs.

**Preferred Sector Pick**<br>
We like CDL Hospitality Trusts and Frasers Hospitality Trust for its diversified portfolio of hotels in key tourist markets, defensive master-leased structure for majority of their assets and its strong sponsor profile.

### Conclusions
Overall, considering rental growth, supply, threats and valuation, we believe that the the hospitalty S-REIT sector should outperform other S-REIT sectors in the mid-term.  It is the only real estate sector where topline growth is supported by robust demand at a time where other real estate sectors have weak growth outlook.  Valuations for the sector is also looks attractive as compared to the others.
