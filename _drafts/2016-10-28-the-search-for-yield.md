The prolonged record-low interest rate cycle has driven investors to high yield stocks, REITs and property in the last few years.  Even now, bond yields and interest rates seems likely to remain at low levels for a longer than expected given the shaky state of the global economy.  REITs and real estate remains well placed to benefit from such economic environment and will continue to outperform other asset classes in the medium term <!--more-->

### Low rates will continue to drive the chase for yield
REITs and property are favored asset classes in low or negative interest rate environment.  Investors are hungry for yield.  For example, we see that Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, one of the world largest pension fund with over USD 1 trillion of assets, is finding it [hard to generate positive returns] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/world-s-biggest-pension-fund-loses-52-billion-as-stocks-slump) in the current low yielding environment.  Overseas REITs and property are able to provide relatively better yielding returns and should see more interest from Japan (and other countries running at negative interest rates).  We expect more capital will be deploy into APAC real estate markets that are still generating relatively good returns, for example Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and China.

### REITs will benefit from a flight to defensiveness
Despite the general view that the Feds will gradually raise rates from December 2016, we think that the REIT and property sector will benefit from a flight to defensiveness trend.  With a slew of high profile global political events, for example, the US presidential election and the Italian referendum, coming up in the next few weeks, we expect volatility and apprehension to permeate the global markets. The stability of dividends provided by REITs provides the certainty in such an unstable and volatile environment.

### Valuations are still attractive
The Singapore REIT market is still the [highest yielding REIT market] (http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapore-reits-offer-highest-dividend-yields-among-developed-markets) among developed countries yielding over 6% per annum on average.  Singapore remains to be a strong investment destination for global investors given the clear rule of law and open business environment.  There are more than 40 REITs and property trusts listed in Singapore, offering a wide range of choices across various property sectors and single-country, regional and global focus.   We believe Singapore REITs remains attractively valued compare to other markets and is a good alternative investment in addition to bonds and stocks.  With ample liquidity in the financial system, the weight of capital will continue to further compress the yields of such good yielding investments

### Biggest risk to our view is a faster than expected interest rate hiking cycle
A more hawkish Fed could rattle the market and affect the performance of equities and REITs.  However, the risk of that happening is low, as We believe that the Feds will hike rates in a gradual and measured manner, and therefore REITs should be able to maintain its stability in their pricing and distributions, notwithstanding temporal knee-jerk reactions when hikes happens.
