Two common valuation metrics used by investors when assessing REIT investments are Premium (Discount) to Net Asset Value ("NAV") and Distribution Yield. The former implies a relative value on the REIT while the latter provides an estimate on the cashflow returns for holding the REIT. As usual, while these are useful shorthands for understanding value, we caution that simply relying on both of these metrics only will not fully reflect the true underlying value and cashflow of the investment properties held by the REIT. <!--more-->

### Premium (Discount) to NAV can be distorted by the valuation of the assets
Bulk of the NAV of a REIT is determined by the valuation of its investment properties. However, Professional Valuers will be the firs tto admit that real estate valuations is more art than science. Valuations can be subjective and is based on available comparable data and (to a lesser degree) the [opinion of the appraiser](http://www.wongpartnership.com/index.php/files/download/2294).

For example, let's compare the valuation of Orchard Hotel (owned by CDL Hospitality Trusts) and Orchard Parade Hotel (owned by Far East Hospitality Trust). Both are hotels in the same price range, located opposite each other along the same road and generally much alike, as demostrated by the similar room prices. However, Orchard Hotel is valued at SGD 684k per room, while Orchard Parade Hotel is valued at SGD 1067k per room. Perhaps Orchard Parade Hotel can argubly say it commands a better frontage, it seems doubtful to us that this accounts for a 56% premium relative to Orchard Hotel, ceteris paribus. 

Based solely on the Premium (Discount) to NAV, it will be premature to conclude if a particular REIT is overvalued or undervalued.

### Distribution yield can be financially engineered (and most often is)
Distributions of a REIT is highly dependedent on the source of funding for its investments. A REIT can increase its distributions by funding its investment with more debt (also means more risk). Distributions can also be increased by paying the management fees in REIT units instead of cash (requiring the issuance of new REIT units which dilutes the investors in the long run). Therefore, investors should not rely solely on comparing distribution yields when assessing REIT investments. 

### Implied property yield provides a more objective approach to valuation
We suggest using implied property yield as a valuation metric to assess REIT investments. This is a commonly used metric by real estate investment professionals/bankers and would be helpful for potential REIT investors when valuing REITs.

**What is property yield?**<br>
Property yield is the rate of return of an investment property and is calculated by taking the annual net operating income of the property divided by the property value. It shows how much cash an investment property can generate for the investor annually after paying expenses.

<center>**Property Yield = Annual Net Operating Income / Property Value**<br><br></center>
For a direct property investment, the property value is (funded through) a combination of debt and equity.<br>

However, for a REIT, the equity (market cap) fluctuates on a day-to-day basis. Hence an **implied property value** can be derived by taking the market cap and adding the net debt (total debt minus cash) of the REIT. Accordingly, investors can calculate the implied property yield by taking the annual net operating income of the property divided by the resultant **implied property value**<br>

<center>**Implied Property Yield = Annual Net Operating Income / (Market cap + Debt - Cash)**<br></center>

### Mathematical example - Frasers Commercial Trust (FCOT)'s implied property yield

Based on FCOT's unit price of SGD 1.39, the implied property yield is calculated as:<br>

**Net Property Income for the last 12 months / (Market cap + Debt - Cash)**<br>
**= SGD 113.7 million / (SGD 1,099 million + SGD 737 million - SGD 63 million)**<br>
**= SGD 113.7 million / SGD 1,773.5 million**<br>
**= 6.4%**<br>

This implies that FCOT's assets yields an average of 6.4% return based on the current trading price of the REIT. The lower the price of a REIT (lower market cap), the higher the implied property yield (better returns). 

Implied property yield as a valuation metric provides a clean assessment of the rate of return of a REIT's properties and can be use as a like-for-like comparison with other physical assets or assets belonging to other REITs to determine how efficiently the REIT's properties are generating returns for its investors

### Limitation of using implied property yield as a valuation metric
There are however limitations in using implied property yield as a valuation metric. This metric does not take into account the amount of debt (risk) and the financing costs (cash leakage) of a REIT. Therefore, investors should do further research on the underlying properties and use implied property yield in conjunction with other financial and non-financial metric to assess the viablity of a REIT investment.
