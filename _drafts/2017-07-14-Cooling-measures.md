Many real estate experts now concur on the [view] (http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/no-lifting-of-property-cooling-measures-till-2017-redas-seminar-speakers) that we won't see a reversal in the [cooling measures] (http://www.srx.com.sg/cooling-measures) in Singapore residential property market in the near future.
  
However, what is more important on many investors' mind is when and more importantly, underwhat conditions will the easing of the tight policy happen.  In today's article, we discuss four factors we believe that will be key to influencing the government to reverse the Singapore property cooling measures.

Some market watchers thinks that the recent easing of car loan financing its a pre-cursor to the removal  of the property cooling measures implemented over 2010-2013 to curtail the rising property prices in Singapore.  We do not subscribe to this view because we believe that the ultimate objective of the goverment for car prices and property prices is fundamentally different.  

The goverment intends for Singapore to move into a [car-lite country] (http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/attractive-transport/2885982.html).  Hence, it is the reasonable to assume the government's objective is to keep the prices of cars and cost of usage high to deter potential car owners.  We can see evidence of this through the recent [rise in public car park rates] (http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/public-car-park-rates-set/2898090.html)(cited reason of rising costs of operations  is just a convenient excuse) and the [lower COE quota](http://www.todayonline.com/singapore-fewer-COEs-available-coming-months) and low  annual vehicle growth rate of 0.25% per annun.  The easing of the car loans is meant to play a part in this direction.

However for property prices, the government objective is to provide a stable and sustainable enviroment for long term capital appreciation.  The property cooling measures is meant to discourage foreign speculative investments and excessive leveraging.

For the easing of the property cooling measures to happen, we believe that the government will want to to see the following signs in the market before adjusting the property-related policies.

### 1. Rising interest rates
Low interest rates encourage property speculation and given Brexit and the lack of direction of the braoder macroeconomy , it is expected that the US interest rates and, correspondingly, the Singapore interest rates (which will remain low for the remaining of 2016, 2017 and we would argue even 2018.  We believe that government will wait for a rise in interest rates (hence increasing the debt servicing burden) before they will consider a relaxation of the cooling measures.

###2. Significant correction in residential property prices
We believe that the goverment wants to achieve stable and gradually appreciating prices for residential property.  Private residential property prices has only corrected 9% from its peak in 2013.  Assume we plot a 3.0% to 3.5% growth trajectory, we think that there is still 9-12% downside for property prices before the the government will consider easing the property cooling measures.  If we project this trajectory forward, we believe that we will not see the relaxtion happen until 2018.

###3.  Completion of majority of the current supply pipeline
Supply of private residential units and executive condominiums (ECs) is to peak in 2016 with expected completion of over 27,000 units for the year.  However, we note that there is still substantial pipeline coming onboard in 2017 and 2018, which is 88% and 72% of the average supply for last 3 years.  We expect that the relaxation of property cooling measures will only come onboad once the bulk of the supply fully hits the market (which will also correspond to more moderate prices)

###4.  Moderate inflow of capital for residential properties
In the last few months, the market has seen an increase in buyers snapping up residential real estate, for both resale and new properties.  While these transactions are mainly done at lower prices, the increase in volume shows that a lot of investor monies are still sitting on the sideline looking to be deployed into the market. 

Based on the factors mentioned above, we hold the view that that the easing of property cooling measures will only kick in from 2018 (or after the above benchmarks are met).  Even so, we expect the easing of property coolling meassures to take place in phases.  We expect the easing to come through a gradual step down of the ABSD and LTV. However, we believe that the TSDR and MSR to here to stay as those policies are to prevent overleverage and systematic risk to build up in the financial sector in Singapore.  This, however, does not mean we discourage investing in residential property at this point in the cycle, if you search hard enough, you may still find a good deal in the market.
