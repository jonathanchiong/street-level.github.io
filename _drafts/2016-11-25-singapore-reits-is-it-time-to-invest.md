Most of the blue-chip Singapore REITs(S-REITs) have traded down [2]% to [9]% since the results of the US Presidential Elections. S-REITs trade at an average of [6.8]% yield and 0.96x Price to NAV (P/NAV) as of [24] Novemeber 2016.  With the correction in S-REIT prices in the last 2 weeks, is now a good time to invest in the sector? <!--more-->

The weakness in S-REITs reflects the risks of an impending Fed rates hike in December 2016 and the uncertainty in global economic growth with the Trump presidency.  However, we think that most of the risks have been priced in and the recent weakness in share prices presents an opportunity for investors to accumuate S-REITs at a reasonable prices.  In this post, we share the reasons behind our view and a simple way to look at S-REIT valuation in general.

### Interest rates will move up, but any increases will be moderate
One of the key drivers of profitability for real estate and REITs is interest costs, and hence, we need to consider the implications of the long term risk-free rate on REITs. The 10-year Singapore Government Securities(SGS) yield[https://secure.sgs.gov.sg/fdanet/SgsBenchmarkIssuePrices.aspx] (also called the SG risk-free rate) is a key benchmark for S-REIT valuations. This benchmark rate has moved up approximately [40] percentage points since the results of the US Presidential Elections reflecting the scenerio of a likely interest rate hike in December 2016.  This move up have resulted in the correction of S-REIT prices in the last two weeks.

While the market consensus is for long term government bond yields to rise, most also expects the increase to be modest.  For the eight-year period from 2000 to 2007 (pre GFC), the 10-yr SGS yielded an average of 3.3% per annum.  However, in the last 8 years (post GFC), the yield was an average of 2.2% per annnum.  We believe that the uncertain global political risk, aging demographics, less aggressive immigration policies, high debt burdens, lower inflation, and the lower growth outlook should support the view of a structurally low risk-free rate.  We therefore expect the 10-yr SGS yield to be stay between 2 to 3% in the next decade.

With the current 10-yr SGS yield at [2.35]%, there is still room for further increase, but we expect the increase to be moderate and over a long period of time.  Any impact to the financial performance of S-REITs should be minimal as S-REITs are pretty lowly leveraged (comparing with private real estate funds and residential investments) and most of the debt are hedged out in  mid-term.

### Value is emerging in S-REITs and downside risks seems limited
Historically, S-REITs trade at an average of 1.0x Price-to-NAV(P/NAV) and [6.2]% yield.  At current P/NAV of 0.96x, S-REITs are trading at close to their -1 Standard Deviation(SD) of 0.92x P/NAV.

In addition, current S-REIT yield of [6.8]% is above the +1 SD of 6.7%.

A more important metric then yield is the yield spread.  The S-REIT yield spread is the difference between the average S-REIT yield and the 10-yr SGS yield.  This is argubably a more important metric than yield because this implies the premium investors wants to be compensated for, for bearing market risk above the risk-free-rate.  

Currently, the yield spread is at 4.4% (S-REIT yield of [6.8]% minus and the 10-yr SGS yield of [2.35]%).  Historically, the mean S-REIT yield spread has been around 4.2%.

The above suggests that S-REIT is trading at slightly below fair value.  Barring any unforeseen major financial catastrophe, the downside risks of S-REIT seems fairly limited.

### Long term valuation of S-REIT looks fair
Here is another back-of-the-envelope way to look at the long term valuation of S-REITs.  If we expect the long term risk-free rate (10-yr SGS yield) to be between 2 to 3% on average, then based on the historical S-REIT yield spread of 4.2%, REITs should trade at around 6.2% to 7.2% yield on a fairly valued basis.

So, based on the current trading yield of [6.8]%, we can conclude that REITs are trading within the fair value range (slightly above the mid-point.  We believe that any (further) price weakness presents a good opportunity to accumulate into the sector.

### Final words
While we have only presented a high level valuation view of the S-REIT sector, investors still need to do their homework and analyze each REIT from a bottom up perspective.  

Many property sectors in Singapore are undergoing structural changes.  For example, the retail scene has evolved significantly from traditional shopping malls to now large format experential retail or online shopping; Conventional large floor plates office spaces for financial instituition are now giving way to hot-desking or co-working spaces for FinTech companies and startups. The way in which real estate spaces are being used is being redefined in this generation.

Investors needs to go back to the fundamentals of real estate - understand how end users of real estate will drive demand for different classes of real estate - to identify pockets of opportunity for investments.
