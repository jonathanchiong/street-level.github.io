##1.  You will always make money in the long run investing in real estate / property prices will always go up.
People generally has the notion that real estate are "safe" investments, and it can't go terribly wrong investing in real estate.  We think this is in part attributed to the emotional security of holding a physical real estate, something investors can touch and feel. This give investors the false sense of security that real estate is safer as compared with other paper assets such as a stocks or bonds.  But is that really true?  

If you look at [recently transacted data] (http://www.theedgeproperty.com.sg/content/huge-losses-despite-nine-year-holding-period), you probably can see that the notion doesn't quite hold water.  Out of 25 residential property transactions dated June 28 to July 5, 10 deals are non-profitable (40% of the transactions).  Even among the profitable deals, only one managed a double digit annualized profit; the remaining, on average, only achieved a mid-single digit annualized profit (slightly better than long term inflation rate) after long holding periods in most cases.  On the other hand, for the unprofitable deals, the investors most likely suffered a significant loss on their equity because of the high leverage typically used in property investing.

Real estate is a very cyclical asset class, profits can be largely driven by timing.  Gone are the days of our parent's time when Singapore was still a developing market and property prices have a lot of room to grow.  Singapore is now a mature and developed city; capital growth and income yield are no longer as rich.  Potential investors need to be cautious about their entry price to ensure they dont get caught out in the wrong part of the cycle.


##2.  Property investment provides you passive income 
This is not always true.  Take an example of a 2-bedroom condominium apartment in District 10 costing S$1.6 milllion.  Assuming a mortgage of 80% of the value i.e. a S$1.28 million property loan, and for a repayment period of 30 years with an interest rate of 1.8%, the resulting monthly repaymentment is approximately S$4,600.  

Based on the current market, the gross rental yield achievable for the property is around 3.0 - 3.5% or S$4,000 - S$4,650.  It is highly likely, that from day one an investor is negative on cashflow on that property i.e. the investor will need to fork out additional cash to service the mortgage after netting off monthly rental. 

Not only will an investor not receive any passive income, he/she will have to keep servicing the "investments" out of his/her own salary until either rental rates have risen substantially or until the property is sold.  We have not even considered the downside scenarios where the property is vacant for months in between leases and interest rates to rise significantly over the holding period (peak SIBOR was more than 3%).  Investors will have to rely heavily on capital gains to make any profit.  But think back to the first point again (does property prices always go up?)
  
##3.  Your residential property is an asset/investment
Someone once said "assets put money in your pocket, and liabilities take money from your pocket".  This statement could not have make more sense - why would you consider something that takes money from your pocket an asset/investment?  For this reason, an investor should not classify his/her residential property (where you reside in in) as an asset/investment.  Simply because, you need to pay mortgage, maintenannce, utility bills, etc - to upkeep the property - all for which there is no rental income for. It is pretty much like owning a car.  Would you treat your car as an investment/asset or more of a liability?

You can never really realize your residential property value, unless through downsizing to a smaller unit (or bunking in with  family or friends).  Potential investors should not treat residential property as part of the investment portfolio as they ultimately have 
different objectives.  

##4.  Expert investment opinions are always right
The so-call experts - property developers, agents, consultants, banks, asset managers, investment companiees - always have a vested 
interest in the market.  Why would you follow someone who will potentially benefit from you transacting in the market?  These "experts" make money regardless of whether an investor do or not.  Media also tend to sensationalized news or they report only what the "experts" want them to. 

Looking back to recent years, rarely any of these “experts” really predicted the global financial crisis or property downturns. "Expert" predictions were always up and positive. Here are a few examples from these "experts":<br><br>

##Final words
Buying a property does not make one a property investor.  Most are just property speculators (buying and praying that the price will go up in a few years).  Reading up news articles and "investment opinions" from "experts" ain't really proper research.  True investors do their homework by carefully analysing the market landscape, identifying the risk factors, calcuating the numbers, and make an informed assessment of their purchase.  If you are really keen to grow your wealth through property investing, do your homework and it will see you through a long way.
