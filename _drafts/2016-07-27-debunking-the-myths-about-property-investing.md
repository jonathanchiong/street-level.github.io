Investing in real estate is a popular way, among Singaporeans, to grow their wealth.  However, there are some common and persistant 
myths around property investing.  In today's article, we discuss how potential investors can invest smartly and avoid some of these 
traps. <br>

##1.  You always make money in property investment in the long run / property prices will always go up.
People generally has the notion that real estate are "safe" investments, and you can't go wrong investing in real estate.  We think this is in part attributed to the emotional element of holding a physical real estate, something investor can touch and feel, and this give investors the false sense of security that real estate is safer versus other paper assets such as a stock or bond.  But is that really true?  

If you look at [recently transacted data] (http://www.theedgeproperty.com.sg/content/huge-losses-despite-nine-year-holding-period), you probably can see that the notion doesn't quite hold water.  Out of 25 residential property transactions dated June 28 to July 5, there are 10 non-profitable deals (40% of the transactions).  Even among the profitable deals, all except for one managed a double digit annualized profit; the remaining only achieved a mid single digit annualized profit - only slightly better than long term inflation rate, after long holding periods in most cases.  On the other hand, for the unprofitable deals, the investors suffered a significant loss on equity because of the high leverage typically used in property investing.

Real estate is a very cyclical asset class.  Apart from the property fundamentals, it's is also hugely driven by timing. Gone are the 
days of our parent's time when Singapore was still a developing market and property prices still has a lot of room to grow.  Singapore is now a mature and developed city; capital growth and income yield are no longer as rich.  Potential investors need to be cautious about their entry price to ensure they dont get caught out in the wrong wave.


##2.  Property investment provides you passive income 
That is not always true.  Take an example of a 2-bedroom condo apartment in District 10 costing S$1.6 milllion.  If assume you take up a mortgage of 80% of the value i.e. S$1.28 million property loan, and for a period of 30 years with an interest rate of 1.8%, the 
resulting monthly repaymentment is approximately S$4,600.  Based on the current market, the gross rental yield you can get out of the property is around 3.0 - 3.5% or S$4,000 - $$4,650.  It is highly likely, that from day one you are negative on cashflow i.e. you will still need to fork out additional cash to service the mortgage after netting off your monthly rental. 

This means that not only will you not receive any passive income, you will face negative cashflow until either rental rates have risen substantially or until you have sold the property.  We have not even consider the downside scenarios where the property can be vacant for certain months in between leases and interest rates to rise significantly over your holding period (peak SIBOR was more than 3.5%).  You will have to rely heavily on capital gains to make any profit.  But think back to the first point again (does property prices always go up?)
  
##3.  Your residential property is an asset/investment
Someone once said "assets put money in your pocket, and liabilities take money from your pocket".  This statement makes a lot of sense - why would you consider something that takes money from your pocket an asset/investment?  For this reason, you should not classify your residential property (where you stay in) as an asset/investment.  Simply because, you need to pay mortgage, maintenannce, utility bills, etc - to upkeep the property - all for which you do not receive any income for it. It is pretty much like owning a a car.  Would you treat your car as an investment/asset or a liability?

You can never really realize your residential property value, unless you downsize to a smaller unit (or bunk in with your family or 
friend).  Potential investors should not treat your residential property as part of the investment portfolio. The two ultimately have 
different objectives.  

##4.  Expert investment opinions are always right
The so-call experts - property developers, agents, consultants, banks, asset managers, investment companiees - always have a vested 
interest in the market.  Why would you follow someone who will potentially benefit from you transacting in the market?  These "experts" make money regardless of whether you do or not.  Media also tend to sensationalized news or they report only what the "experts" want them to. 

Looking back to recent years, rarely any of these “experts” really predicted the global financial crisis or property downturns. "Expert" predictions were always up and positive. Here are a few examples from these "experts":<br>

**Final words
Buying a property doesn't make one a property investor.  Most are just property speculators (buying and praying that the price will go up in a few years).  Reading up news articles and "investment opinions" from "experts" aint really proper research.  True investors do their homework by carefully analysing the market, identifying the risk factors, calcuating the numbers, and make an informed assessment of their purchase price.  If you are really keen to grow your wealth through property investing, do your homework and it will see you through a long way.
