[Latest estimates](http://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/signs-of-slow-growth-ahead) from the Ministry of Trade and Industry indicates that Singapore's economy is forecast to grow by 1-2% in 2016.  Against the backdrop of continued slow growth and the [gloomy economic climate](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-14/singaporeans-worried-over-jobs-and-pay-are-glummest-since-2009), we think it is timely to take a step back to consider where Singapore is currently, what the economy would look like in the next 20 years and consider what will drive Singapore real estate value in the long run.<!--more-->

### Singapore is now a mature economy, lower growth is the new normal
Singapore's economy has evolved significantly since the country's independence in 1965. The country has moved from a third world to a first world nation in a short span of over 30 years. From the 70s to the 90s, the country has been on a fast-growth mode with the GDP growing at an average rate of 8.2% per annum.  However, the growth of the economy has since slowed to an average of 5.5% per annum from 2000 to 2015, reflecting the more mature and developed nature of the econony.  We need to recognize and get used to the fact that Singapore is now on a diffferent growth trajectory and will see slower growth going forward.  IMF have forecasted Singapore to grow at an average of 2.4% per annum from 2016 - 2021.

### Slow growth is not necessarily bad; lower growth is on a larger base
We need to consider the slower growth in the context of how much economy has grown over the years.  Singapore's economy has more than doubled from 2000 to 2015.  The lower growth rate on a larger base means that Singapore is still adding significant chunks to the economy every year.  In the next 5-6 years, Singapore will add to the economy the size of a smaller Singapore in 1984.  This is still quite sizable considering that population growth is moderating.

### Structure of economy is now different and will continue to change going forward
As Singapore continue to restructure its economy, it is important for investors to consider how the quickly the structure of the economy has evolved in the last 15 years.  Singapore's economy is now more diversified and less reliant on manufacturing; services and tertiary industries now are the main drivers of GDP growth and the trending will continue.

From a real estate perspective, this means that traditional end-user demand of real estate is going to be different.  Some examples are:
1. manufacturing sector will no longer drive usage of industrial space
2. traditional retail trade are now ousted in favour of experential/large format retail experience in shopping malls
3. co-working spaces will emerge to change the way office space is being used. etc.  

This also means that obsolence risk for real estate is becoming more real as we see some sectors and industries in the old economy fade away.

### But end-user demand will still continue to drive real estate value, so its important to identify the trends that are emerging 

Real estate demand can be quite policy-driven, hence we believe that real estate investors can take cue from the economic policies that the Singapore and regional governments will or has implemented to project how the economy will develop.

Below we share some key themes we see playing out in the near future which can drive end-user demand of real estate.

1.  Big focus in improving productivity means the industrial sector will see a move towards higher value-add industrial such as advanced engineering, hi-tech manufacturing and R&D.  JTC will become more selective towards industrial tenants and usage of industrial space.

2.  The support packages announced as part of the Industry Transformation Program in Budget 2016 will see automation and knowledge intensive industry gather traction.  SMEs, techology and media companies, and start-ups will form the new demand source for industrial and office spaces.

3.  Services industries will continue to be the forward drivers of GDP growth with Singapore being the regional APAC/ASEAN hub of tourism, medical services and financial services.  This would continue to form the core demand for associated real estate assets.

4.  Regional economic policies such as the Asean Economic Community and the Trans-Pacific Partnership will be long term drivers underpinning the above mentioned themes.


### Closing remarks
Slower economic growth will be the flavour of the decade (or two) and the investment world has argubaly gotten a lot more complicated in the last decare.  However, we belive that investors should focus on where the end-user demand of real estate is to find investment opportunities in Singapore.

In our subsequent posts, we will share sector specific insights and ideas on how investors in Singapore can capture value in real estate investments.  We hope the above is helpful for real estate investors to form high level macroeconomic view of Singapore.  We will love to hear your thoughts and exchange of ideas in the comment box below.
