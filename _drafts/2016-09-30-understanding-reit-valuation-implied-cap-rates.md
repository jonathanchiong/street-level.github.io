Two common valuation metrics used by investors when assessing REIT investments are Premium/Discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) and Distribution Yield.  The former tells you the relative value of the REIT while the latter provides the estimated cashflow returns of the investment.  We suggest, however, that both of these metrics may not accurately reflect the true underlying value and cashflow of the investment properties held by the REIT. <!--more-->

### Premium/discount to NAV can be distorted by the valuation of the assets
Bulk of the NAV of a REIT is determined by the valuation of its investment properties.  However, real estate industry professionals would be able to tell you that property valuation is part art-part science.  Valuation can be subjective and is based on available comparable data, and (partially) the opinion of the appraiser.

For example, compare the valuation of Orchard Hotel (owned by CDL Hospitality Trusts) and Orchard Parade Hotel (owned by Far East Hospitality Trust).  Both are mid-tier hotels and is just opposite each other along the same road.  However, you will see that Orchard Hotel is valued at SGD 684k per room, while Orchard Parade Hotel is valued at SGD 1067k per room.  While one may argue that Orchard Parade Hotel has a better frontage, it is contentious whether Orchard Parade Hotel commands a 56% premium to Orchard Hotel notwithstanding other valuation factors. 

For this reason, it is hard to tell solely based on the trading premium/discount to NAV, whether a particular REIT is overvalued or undervalued. 

### Distribution yield can be financially engineered (and most often is)
Distributions of a REIT is highly dependedent on the source of funding for its investments. A REIT can increase its distributions by funding its investment with more debt (also means more risk).  Distributions can also be increased by paying the management fees in REIT units instead of cash (requiring the issuance of new REIT units which dilutes the investors in the long run).  Therefore, investors should not rely solely on comparing distribution yields when assessing REIT investments. 

### Implied capitalisation rate (cap rate) provides a more objective approach to valuation
We suggest using implied cap rates as a valuation metric to assess REIT investments.  This is a commonly used metric by real estate investment professionals/bankers and would be helpful for potential REIT investors when valuing REITs.

**What is cap rate?**<br>
Cap rate is the potential rate of return of an investment property and is calculated by taking the annual net operating income of the property divided by the property value.  It shows how much cash an investment property can generate for the investor annually after paying expenses.

<center>**Cap rate = Annnual Net Operating Income / Property Value**<br><br></center>
For a direct property investment, the property value is (funded through) a combination of debt and equity.<br>

However, for a REIT, the equity is the market cap which fluctuates on a day-to-day basis.  Hence an **implied property value** can be derived by taking the market cap and adding the net debt (total debt minus cash) of the REIT.  Accordingly, investors can assess the resultant implied cap rate by taking the annual net operating income of the property divided by the **implied property value**<br>

<center>**Implied Cap Rate = Annual Net Operating Income / (Market cap + Debt - Cash)**<br></center>

### Mathematical example - Frasers Commercial Trust (FCOT)'s implied cap rate

Based on FCOT's unit price of SGD 1.39, the implied cap rate is calculated as:<br>

**Annual Net Property Income (Last Twelve Months) / (Market cap + Debt - Cash)**<br>
**= SGD 113.7 million / (SGD 1,099 million + SGD 737 million - SGD 63 million)**<br>
**= SGD 113.7 million / SGD 1,773.5 million**<br>
**= 6.4%**<br>

This implies that thats FCOT's assets yields a 6.4% annual return based on the current trading price of the REIT.  The lower the price of a REIT (lower market cap), the higher the implied cap rate (better returns).  

Implied cap rate as a valuation metric provides a clean assessment of the rate of return of a REIT's properties and can be use as a comparison with other physical assets or assets belonging to other REITs to determine how efficiently the REIT's properties are generating returns for its investors

### Limitation of implied cap rate as a valuation metric
There are however limitations in using implied cap rate as a valuation metric. This metric does not take into account the amount of debt (risk) and the financing costs (cash leakage) of a REIT.  Investor should do further research on the underlying properties and use implied cap rate in conjunction with other financial and non-financial metric to assess the viablity of a REIT investment.
